    Hardware:
    CPU: 4 cores
    Memory: 16GB RAM
    Storage: 1TB SSD/HHD
    Network: At least 20Mb bandwidth with an independent IP address

Server Preparation

    sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install git curl -y
    sudo apt install make clang pkg-config libssl-dev build-essential -y

Install Docker

   sudo apt install docker.io -y

Install Node

Change your "NodeName"

    ids="NodeName" && docker run -d -p 30333:30333 boolnetwork/bnk-node:release --validator --chain=tee --name $ids

Check logs:

      docker logs -f $(docker ps -a | grep bnk-node | awk '{print $1}')

Get Your Session Keys:

      curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9933 -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"author_rotateKeys","params":[]}'

Your result should be resemble to this sample:

      {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x963d40e26c1d69acf3f75f96cd7782576382713b650d2ea81f5c8dbeb3797e1f17df3a8ab0d3a2dc3218972fdebe47a4463523ae1bbc0a6c91f3b33ace76c0eb","id":1}

Set Validator:

      https://dashboard.boolscan.com/node/?network=devnet

**Choose Network: DEVNET -> Connect Wallet -> To Be Validator**

Set parameters, including commission, allows third parties to join, and RotateKey:

    Commission: The percentage of the reward received by the validator when the reward is distributed. If the rewards are the same, the lower the commission means that the nominators will receive more rewards.
    Allowing third parties to join: if permitted, a third party may become a nominator for the validator, but not otherwise.
    RotateKey: it is used to bind the account and validate the node relationship（0x96***0eb generated by the previous step）.
    Set the amount of pledge and income distribution:
    + Continue Pledge: Continue to pledge funds to the account when claiming the reward.
    + Direct benefit: The rewards will not continue to be pledged, but transferred to the personal spendable account.
